**5.5 Endurance**

**5.5.1 General**

The test described is a type test (laboratory tests) not a quality control tests carried out during manufacture.

This clause specifies a method for testing the mechanical endurance or wear resistance of the moving parts and specifies the corresponding requirements.

**5.5.2 Principle**

The principle of the test is to subject the tapware to a specified number of operations to ensure its behaviour over an extended period of time.

Tests are carried out at a static pressure of (0,4 ± 0,05) MPa ((4 ± 0,5) bar).

The test is carried out operating the tapware in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The system shall be adapted to suit the type of tapware under test.

Tapware is to be tested as supplied.

**5.5.3 Procedure for single taps**

Mount the tap on the test machine and connect a cold water supply circuit that shall be capable of delivering water at a static pressure of (0,4 ± 0,05) MPa ((4 ± 0,5) bar).

The tap shall be opened and allowed to close using its normal mode of operation.

The opening and closing cycle shall be repeated 200 000 times.

If the tap is battery operated, the battery can be changed during the test. The number of times the battery is changed shall be recorded.





**5.5.4 Procedure for mixers**

Mount the tap on the test machine and connect the cold water supply circuit with cold water and the hot water supply with water at a temperature of (65 ± 2)°C.

With the mixer closed, adjust the hot and cold water pressures upstream of the mixer to (0,4 ± 0,05) MPa ((4 ± 0,5) bar).

The following cycle shall be repeated 70 000 times:

1) adjust the temperature setting device in the mid blend position, mixer closed;

2) actuate the tap;

3) while tap flowing, adjust the temperature setting device to the cold position in approximately 1,5 s;

4) await end of flow;

5) wait for 5 s;

6) actuate the tap;

7) while tap flowing, adjust the temperature setting device to the hot position in approximately 3 s;

8) await end of flow;

9) wait for 5 s;

10) actuate the tap;

11) while tap flowing, adjust the temperature setting device to the mid blend position in approximately 1,5 s;

12) await end of flow;

13) wait for 5 s.

The tap shall be opened and allowed to close using its normal mode of operation.

If the tap is battery operated, the battery can be changed during the test. The number of times the battery is changed shall be recorded.

**5.5.5 Requirements**

For the duration of the test, no component shall break and the tapware shall continue to operate.

After the total amount of cycles, verify that:

— when tested as specified in 4.6, leaktightness is maintained.
