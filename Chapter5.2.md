**5.2 Dimensional characteristics**

**5.2.1 General**

General comment on drawings:

The design and construction of components without defined dimensions permit various design solutions to be 

adopted by the manufacturer.

Special cases are covered in 5.2.10.

**5.2.2 Tap with visible body for horizontal surfaces**

The standardized dimensions of electronic opening and closing tapware (see Figure 3 and Table 4) shall:

— facilitate their mounting and interchangeability on sanitary appliances complying with EN 31, EN 35, EN 36, 

and EN 695; 

— provide various options for connecting to the water supply.

| G             | 45 min.            | taps intended for Type 1 supply systems and taps intended for Type 2 supply Smallest dimension of the tap base |
| L             |                    | systems – except sinks. Value that enables the tapware to be mounted on a support between 1 mm and 18 mm in |

<sup>a</sup> Larger dimensions may be required per national regulatory provisions.

NOTE      Supply by flexible hose complying with EN 13618 is permitted.



**5.2.3 Taps with visible body for mounting on vertical surfaces**

The standardized dimensions of electronic opening and closing tapware (see Figure 4 and Table 5) shall:

— comply with Figure 4 and Table 5 in the case of inlet dimensions;

— provide various options for connecting to the water supply.

**Figure 4 — Threaded inlets of taps with visible body for mounting on vertical surfaces**

**Table 5 — Dimensions of threaded inlets**

| Dimension | Values (mm) | Values (mm) |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| A | G 1/2 B | G 3/4 B |
| C | 11 min. | 13 min. |

**5.2.4 In-line tapware with threaded inlet and outlet**

**5.2.4.1  Inlets and outlets aligned**

The standardized dimensions of electronic opening and closing tapware (see Figure 5 and Table 6) shall:

— comply with Figure 5 and Table 6 in the case of inlet dimensions;

— provide various options for connecting to the water supply.

**Figure 5 — Tapware with inlets and outlets aligned**

**5.2.4.2** 

**Inlets and outlets at right angles**

The standardized dimensions of electronic opening and closing tapware (see Figure 6 and Table 6) shall:

— comply with Figure 6 and Table 6 in the case of inlet dimensions;

— provide various options for connecting to the water supply.

**Figure 6 — Tapware with inlets and outlets at right angles**

**Table 6 — Dimensions of threads**

| Dimension | Values （mm） | Values （mm） |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

|*C*       |8 min.     |10 min.|

In the event of a different inlet and outlet size the nominal size is that of the inlet, and the outlet size shall be stated 

(e.g. In-line tapware G 1/2 B male with female outlet G 3/4 with inlet and outlet aligned).

**5.2.5 Concealed tapware for vertical surfaces**

The dimensions are left to the discretion of the manufacturer.
