**7.5 Hydraulic characteristics**

**7.5.1 General**

This subclause specifies a test method with which the following is measured, using a given pressure:

— flush flow rate;

— impact force;

— flush time;

— flush water volume;

— pressure increase (water hammer) Δ*P* while closing the tap.

In this subclause, the corresponding requirements are specified.

**7.5.2 Test method**

**7.5.2.1** 

**General**

The WC flushing valve is assembled with a flushing pipe corresponding with the nominal size DN in accordance 

with Table 20. 

**Figure 20 — Flushing pipe**

**Table 20 — Flushing pipe dimensions**

**7.5.2.2** 

**Principle**

The tests shall be performed with cold water.

Before each test, the valve to be tested is operated five times before taking the measurement (air bleeding).

The tests are performed according to the sequences indicated in Table 21. 

**Table 21 — Sequences of tests**



**7.5.2.3** 

**Procedure for flow rate / impact force test**

For the measurement of flow rate/impact force, the tapware is to be adjusted and operated in accordance with the 

manufacturer’s information, depending on the valve design type.

To set the dynamic pressures and measure the impact force, the tapware shall be held in an open position.

**7.5.2.4** 

**Procedure for flow rate / volume test**

For the measurement of the flow rate / volume according to the flow rate curve, the adjustment of the tapware is not 

modified, regarding to the precedent test.

The flush time is to be taken from the start of activation.

The measurement is to be taken by simultaneously recording pressure and flow rate as a function of time.

The volume can be measured by continuous recording of the flow curve.

To check the requirements in accordance with Figure 21, depending on the valve design type according to 7.2, the 

course of the flush flow rate curve in relation to time is evaluated from the diagrams which have been recorded 

during the test.
