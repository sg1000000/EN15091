**4.5.4 Electric strength and insulation resistance of the solenoid valve**

Solenoid valves shall comply with EN 60730-2-8, where applicable.

**4.5.5 Operational safety**

**4.5.5.1 Test procedure for mains operated tapware**

The test is conducted with cold water.

Tapware intended for Type 1 water supply systems are operated at a dynamic pressure of (0,3 ± 0,02) MPa ((3 ± 0,2) bar).

Tapware intended for Type 2 water supply systems are operated at a dynamic pressure of (0,02 ± 0,005) MPa ((0,2 ± 0,05) bar).

Actuate the tap.

Cut off the electrical supply.

**4.5.5.2** 

**Requirements for mains operated tapware**

The tapware shall always close.

**4.5.5.3** 

**Test procedure for battery operated tapware**

The test is conducted with cold water.

The principle of the test consists of verifying that when the battery loses its charge, the tapware closes.

Tapware intended for Type 1 water supply systems is operated at a dynamic pressure of (0,3 ± 0,02) MPa ((3 bar ± 0,2) bar).

Tapware intended for Type 2 water supply systems is operated at a dynamic pressure of (0,02 ± 0,005) MPa ((0,2 ± 0,05) bar).

During testing the battery is replaced by an adapted power supply with adjustable voltage.

Beginning at 0,9 x Un (battery nominal voltage).

a) Actuate the tap.

b) While the water is running, reduce the voltage by 0,1 V.

c) Wait until the tap closes or actuate the closure of the tap.

d) Repeat a), b), c) until the tap does not operate anymore.

**4.5.5.4  Requirements for battery operated tapware**

After finishing the test, the tap shall remain in closed position.

**4.6 Leaktightness characteristics**

**4.6.1 General**

The tests described are type tests (laboratory tests) and not quality control tests carried out during manufacture.

This subclause specifies test methods for verifying the leaktightness of electronic tapware and defines the corresponding requirements (see Table 4).

Tests are carried out with cold water.

**4.6.2 Principle**

The principle of the test consists of checking under cold water pressure the leaktightness of the tapware (body, head-body unit, etc.).

**4.6.3 Apparatus**

A hydraulic test circuit capable of supplying the required static and dynamic pressures and of maintaining them throughout the duration of the test.

**4.6.4 Leaktightness of tapware upstream of the obturator**

**4.6.4.1  Procedure**

Connect the tapware to the test circuit with the outlet orifice open, and generally turned downwards.

With the obturator closed, apply a static water pressure at the inlet of the tapware of (1,6 ± 0,05) MPa ((16 ± 0,5) bar) for (60 ± 5) s.

**4.6.4.2 Requirements**

Throughout the duration of the test there shall be no leakage at the obturator and no leakage or seepage through the walls.

**4.6.5 Leaktightness of tapware downstream of the obturator with the obturator open**

This test only applies to tapware (Clause 5) and urinal flushing valves (Clause 6).

**4.6.5.2  Procedure**

— Connect the tapware to the test circuit with the outlet orifice(s) artificially closed, and generally turned downwards;
