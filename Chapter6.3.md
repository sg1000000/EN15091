**6.3 Classification of flushing urinal valves 冲洗小便阀的分类**

Urinal flushing valves are classified as defined in Table 14.

Flushing valves with flush time/flush water volume control may satisfy the requirements of several volume classes. In this case several classes may be declared.

National Regulations exist in some EU member states that set maximum flush volumes that are lower than those indicated in the European standard.

**Table 14 — Classification**

| Volume class | Volume delivered (min.) | Volume delivered (max.) |
