**6.8 机械耐力 Mechanical endurance**

**6.8.1 总则 General**

The test described is a type test (laboratory test), not a quality control test carried out during manufacture.

This clause specifies a test method for verifying the mechanical endurance or resistance to wear of the mechanical elements of urinal flushing valves.

The test consists of subjecting a urinal flushing valve to a specified number of operations in order to establish its behaviour over time.

Tests are carried out at a dynamic pressure of (0,25 ± 0,02) MPa ((2,5 ± 0,2) bar) with cold water.

**6.8.2 仪器 Apparatus**

A suitable test rig and water supply circuit to allow normal operation of the flushing valve within the parameters described.

**6.8.3 Procedure**

Connect the flushing valve to be tested to the water supply circuit, adjusted to deliver cold water at a dynamic flow pressure of (0,25 ± 0,02) MPa ((2,5 ± 0,2) bar):

— operate the flushing valve and measure the rate of flow whilst the flush is being delivered;

— measure also the volume of flush water delivered – which shall comply with one of the values specified in Table 16;

— wait until 2 s after the flow has stopped;

— subject the flushing valve to 70 000 flushing cycles;

— if the valve is battery operated, the battery can be changed during the test; the number of times the battery is changed shall be recorded.

**6.8.4 Requirements**

— Flow rate shall still comply with the appropriate minimum requirement specified in Table 16;

— flush volume measured under the same supply conditions as those specified for the test shall not vary by more than 25 % from the volume delivered initially;

— requirements of 4.6 (leaktightness) shall be maintained.
