**5.6 Acoustic characteristics**

**5.6.1 General**

The tests described are type test (laboratory tests) not quality control tests carried out during manufacture.

This clause specifies the test method for classifying electronic tapware by acoustic group (I, II or not classified), and where applicable an indication of the flow rate class (A, S, B, C or D, Z) used to determine the acoustic group, for tapware intended for use in supply systems of type 1.

**5.6.2 Procedure**

**5.6.2.1  Mounting and operating conditions for tapware**

The mounting and operating conditions shall be as specified in EN ISO 3822-2.

**5.6.2.2  Test method**

The tests are carried out in accordance with EN ISO 3822-1, EN ISO 3822-2 and EN ISO 3822-4.

**5.6.3 Requirements**

**5.6.3.1  Expression of results**

The results of the measurements taken in accordance with EN ISO 3822-1 through EN ISO 3822−4 are expressed by the acoustic level of the tapware *L*ap in dB(A).

**5.6.3.2  Determination of the acoustic group**

The acoustic group is determined by the value of ‘*L*ap’ obtained at a flow pressure of 0,3 MPa (3 bar). The tapware is classified in acoustic group I, II or U as shown in Table 12:

**Table 12 — Acoustic groups**





The acoustic test is not obligatory. Tapware not tested can be certified under the designation “not classified” and will be considered to have a *L*ap of greater than 30 dB(A).

**5.6.3.3  Flow classes**

If the tapware has a flow rate restrictor conforming to EN 246, the measurement is carried out without these fittings as these are subject to special acoustic measurements. In such cases, the supplied flow rate restrictor is replaced by a calibrated flow rate restrictor.

If the tapware has a special outlet fitting, the tests are carried out with the tapware as delivered by the manufacturer.

For tapware with no outlet fitting (shower attachment outlet for example), the tests are carried out by replacing this fitting with a hydraulic resistance with calibrated flow rate in accordance with the annexes of EN ISO 3822-4.

Hydraulic resistances tested alone are defined in six classes as a function of their calibrated flow rate at 0,3 MPa (3 bar) as specified in Table 13:



**Table 13 — Classes of flow rate**



If relevant, tapware is allocated to the flow rate class which corresponds to the flow rate of the hydraulic resistance with calibrated flow rate with which it is tested.
