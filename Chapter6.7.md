**6.7 小便冲洗阀水锤的测量 Measurement of water hammer for urinal flushing valves**

**6.7.1  水锤试验原理 Principle of water hammer test**

The principle is to verify that the peak of pressure is limited, when a flushing valve closes.

**6.7.2 试验装置 Test apparatus**

**6.7.2.1 General**

A test rig as described in Figure 15 is used.

**6.7.2.2 Procedure of choice of pipe sizing**

Select the size of the supply pipe (2) according to Table 17 using the flow rate value (*Q* in l/s) according to 

Table 16.

**Table 17 — Dimension of the supply pipe**

| DN<br>≤ to | Q L/s<br/>≤ to | D int | Pipe  |
| ---------- | -------------- | ----- | ----- |
| 15         | 0.15           | 13    | 13×15 |
| 15         | 0.3            | 20    | 20×22 |
| 20         | 0.5            | 20    | 20×22 |

**6.7.3 程序 Procedure**

The supply circuit shall deliver cold water at a static pressure of (0,5 <sup>+0</sup><sub>-0,02</sub>) MPa ((5 <sup>+0</sup><sub>-0,2</sub>) bar), with a pump with variable speed.

Procedure of filling of the air vessel in order to fill it at 50 % air:

a) depressurize the test rig;

b) fill the vessel with compressed air to 2,5 bar (0,25 MPa);

c) pressurize the rig with water at 5 bar (0,5 MPa) by regulating the pump speed;

- 1) connect the sample (5) at the test rig, directly after the pressure tee (4);
- 2) open the tap at minimum 5 times in order to completely de-aerate the circuit;
- 3) adjust the static pressure at 5 bar (0,5 MPa);

d) disable speed regulation of pump;

e) operate the flushing valve 5 s in order to stabilize the pressure, record the pressure and the flow rate;

f) allow the flushing valve to close, whilst continually recording the pressure.

Repeat the tests 3 times.

If a flow rate adjustment device has been set as indicated in 6.6.2.2, it will not be modified, unless if the flow rate exceeds 0,6 l/s . In this case, the flow rate shall be adjusted to 0,6 l/s.

**6.7.4 要求 Requirements**

The average of the peaks of pressure between the maximum pressure recorded during closure and the static 

pressure 0,5 MPa (5 bar) shall not exceed 0,3 MPa (3 bar).
