**6.6 水力特性 Hydraulic characteristics**

**6.6.1 总则 General**

This clause specifies a test method for measuring at a given pressure:

— flow rate;

— volume of flush water delivered.

**6.6.2  试验方法 Test method**

**6.6.2.1 Test apparatus**

The test rig comprizes that part illustrated by element I of the apparatus specified in EN 12541:2002, Figure 6. 

**6.6.2.2 Test methodology**

Open the urinal flushing valve 5 times in order to completely de-aerate the circuit. Use cold water. 

Have the flushing valve operated, following the operating mode.

The adjustment of the flow rate can be made in operating the isolating valve if it exists. If the flushing valve is supplied with an automatic flow mechanism it will be tested as delivered.

The measurement is taken from the start of activation.

Measuring may be made by simultaneous recording of pressure and flow rate as a function of time.

The volume may be measured by continually recording the flow rate curve.

**6.6.2.3 Requirements**

The flow rate and volume of flush shall comply with the values specified in Table 16.

**Table 16 — Flow rate**
