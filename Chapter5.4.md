**5.4 Water hammer**

**5.4.1 Principle of water hammer test**

The principle is to verify, that the peak of pressure is limited when the tap closes. This applies only to devices intended for use on water systems of Type 1.



**5.4.2  Test apparatus**

A test rig as described in Figure 15 is to be used:



**Key**

1 Supply by pump with variable speed drive at a static pressure of (0,5 <sup>+0</sup><sub>-0,02</sub>) MPa [(50,5 <sup>+0</sup><sub>-0,2</sub>) bar]

2 Air vessel of 5 l capacity half-filled with air at a static pressure of 0,5 MPa (5 bar)

3 Supply circuit comprising 9 m of copper pipe (see Table 11) wound into a coil of 260 mm internal radius minimum or composed of straight lengths incorporating a maximum of 5 bends with an internal radius greater than 260 mm

4 Pressure tee complying with EN ISO 5167-1 with pressure sensor capable of measuring 0 MPa (0 bar) to 2,0 MPa (20 bar) with a frequency of more than 5 kHz; the recording shall be made at a frequency exceeding 1 kHz

5 Tap to be tested

**5.4.3 Procedure**

The supply circuit shall deliver cold water at a static pressure of ((0,5 <sup>+0</sup><sub>-0,02</sub>) MPa [(50,5 <sup>+0</sup><sub>-0,2</sub>) bar], with a pump with variable speed. Procedure of filling of the air vessel in order to fill it at 50 % air:

a) depressurize the test rig;

b) fill the vessel with compressed air to 0,25 MPa (2,5 bar);

c) pressurize the rig with water at 0,5 MPa (5 bar) by regulating the pump speed:

- 1) connect the sample (5) at the test rig, directly after the pressure tee (4);
- 2) open the tap at minimum 5 times in order to completely de-aerate the circuit;
- 3) adjust the static pressure at 5 bar;

d) disable speed regulation of pump;

e) operate the tap 5 s in order to stabilize the pressure, record the pressure and the flow rate;

f) allow the tap to close, whilst continually recording the pressure.

If a mixing valve is being tested, both inlets are connected, and the test is conducted at full cold, full hot and mid-blend positions. Follow the procedure 3 times.

**5.4.4 Requirements**

The average of the 3 tests of the peaks of pressure for each position (hot, cold, mid-blend) between the maximum pressure on closure and the static pressure of 5 bar (0,5 MPa) shall be less than or equal to 0,3 MPa (3 bar).
